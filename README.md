# DeviCeSS
How would it be? Devices, DeviCeSS or maybe DeviCSS?

This repository is a lost and found drawer.

By consuming an API made by me to listen to radios from different parts of the world, the content is played on different devices.

The repository is designed to use and experiment with CSS as well as different other technologies, indicated in the table below for each of the devices.

In each of them, you can find a readme file in its folder to have more knowledge about what it does.
